# 1.0 **Introduction to Mutational Genomics**
We have sequenced the whole genome of a rice individual that is postulated or even proven of showing mutant phenotypes that we desire.
in hope to quickly find the genes controlling them.
However, please keep in mind that finding the function of a gene isn’t straightforward as it seems it is.
